# wikipedia-takehome

This is a small script downloading the table of content 
from any wikipedia page, in different language.

There is a live version of this program at 
https://morning-mountain-52029.herokuapp.com!

This was fairly easy - the hardest part was not to get 
distracted and start reading Wikipedia!
